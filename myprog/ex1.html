		This is jack. He's an odd little boy that got an empty box for his birthday. He may <i>look</i> happy, but he's a 			<i>little</i>disappointed. Now he'll have to put a few things in the box.<br>
		Jack would really like...<br>
		<ul>
			<li>Roller blades</li>
			<li>Magic tricks</li>
			<li>Anything Pokemon</li>
			<li>A motorized Lego set</li>
		</ul>
		<br>
		You can get all this (and more) at an online toy store. Two verypopular ones are <a href="">toysrus.com</a>and<a href="">eToys.</a>
